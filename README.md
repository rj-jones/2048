# 2048 Game Guide

"2048" is a widely popular single-player sliding block puzzle game. It's easy to learn but presents a significant challenge as you play. This guide provides an overview of the game's mechanics and objectives.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Grid Layout**: The game is played on a 4x4 grid.

- **Starting Tiles**: The game begins with two numbered tiles, typically 2s or occasionally a 4.

## How to Play

1. **Moving Tiles**: Players can slide tiles in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right) using the arrow keys or WASD.

2. **Combining Tiles**: When two tiles with the same number touch due to a move, they merge into a single tile. The value of the new tile is the sum of the two original tiles (e.g., two 2s combine to form a 4).

3. **Objective**: The primary goal is to create a tile with the number 2048, though you can continue to play to achieve higher scores.

4. **Scoring**: Points are scored by combining tiles, with the score equal to the value of the new tile.

## Game Over

- The game ends when the grid is full, and no further moves or combinations are possible.

## Strategy

- As the game progresses, it becomes more challenging to manage the grid and combine tiles effectively.
